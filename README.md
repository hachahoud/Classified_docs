# Classified_docs

Classified Documents is a program that has the purpose of protecting important files to users in case of loss.
The chosen files will be automatically deleted if the user doesn't log in for a previous chosen period.

This is a script that will do the following:
  - manage user accounts.
  - ask for file paths.
  - delete a path when a precise period of time has passed.
